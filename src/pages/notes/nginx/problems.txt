it seem by when you install nodejs at the first time it install node version 12 even after you run


 curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo -E bash -



dpkg: error processing archive /var/cache/apt/archives/nodejs_18.12.1-deb-1nodesource1_amd64.deb (--unpack):

Basic understanding of nginx:

when you first install nginx it come with the default config files

lets look at nginx.confg:

user workr_process, error_log and pid they are the config for nginx itself not for any server config
